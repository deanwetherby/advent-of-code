Pulses (Lo/Hi), inverters, flip-flops. I don't want to do this one.

## part 1

flip-flops %
inverter & aka conjunction

Horrifically worded:

> Pulses are always processed in the order they are sent. So, if a pulse is sent to modules a, b, and c, and then module a processes its pulse and sends more pulses, the pulses sent to modules b and c would have to be handled first.
